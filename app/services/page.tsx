          I take on a small number of outside engagements alongside my own
          research. Engagements range from 2-week scoped builds to multi-month
          collaborations. Below are the three shapes most of my work tends to
          fall into — if your problem looks adjacent, get in touch.

          Not every engagement fits these three shapes. If you have a research
          collaboration, a one-off prototype, or a question about whether a
          problem is even worth automating — reach out and we can figure it
          out together.
